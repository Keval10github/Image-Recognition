## **📜 Overview**
Welcome to the **Image Recognition Project** by **Keval Ravani**! 🚀  
This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset**, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, such as 🛩️ airplanes, 🚗 automobiles, 🐦 birds, 🐱 cats, and more.

## **📂 Project Structure**
The project follows a well-defined pipeline:
1. **Dataset Loading**: CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded using TensorFlow.
2. **Preprocessing**: Images are normalized for better model performance.
3. **Model Construction**: A CNN is built using TensorFlow/Keras.
4. **Training**: The model is trained on the dataset.
5. **Evaluation**: The model's accuracy is tested on unseen data.
6. **Visualization**: Random samples are visualized with predictions.
